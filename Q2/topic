// How does reduce differ from forEach in terms of return value? Explain with examples.

// reduce is used to reduce the array into a single value and returns it, but when we use forEach it will work similar but forEach
// will not return new array or value

/* 

ex : let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let output = arr.reduce((acc, ele) => {
        return acc + ele;
    }, 0)

let sum = 0;
arr.forEach((ele) =>{
        return sum = sum + ele;
    })
