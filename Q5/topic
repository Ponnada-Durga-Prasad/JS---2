How do bind, call, and apply manipulate the this context? Write an example.

call is basically used to link a function of one object to work on another particular object, but we need to make sure that all the availble parameters
in the the function linked should be present in the another object we are willing to link. call do't create a new function like bind, and it is executed immediatedly.

bind

bind is used to create a this to particular object on another another method of another object, but this creates new funtion and it is not invoked until it is called.

apply is similar to call, but here the arguments are passed in the array form, but in call it is passed separately.
